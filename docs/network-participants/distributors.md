# Distributors

Distributors are that accounts which are paid for distributing content.

Usually, these are sites or applications that provide their users with the opportunity to use Ace Network services.

Distributors profit is a commission for traffic billing and payment for access to content in the premium pools.

Technically, a distributor is an ordinary account on the Network. To be paid as a distributor, the owner of that account has to register his or her public key when launching content playback sessions on client nodes. A detailed description of this process will be available later.
