# Copyright holders

A copyright holder could be assigned to every [Content ID][1] in Ace Network.

A copyright holder is an account on the Network that receives a commission if their content gets paid for.

Only a special type of account, oracle, can bind content to the copyright holder.

The list of oracles is stored in the system settings.
Adding and removing oracles is done by [vote][2] of the [XAS][3] holders.

Each oracle is represented by a separate business entity that can play such a role (for example a law firm), the valid URL of the website of such entity is mandatory and stores in the 'home domain' field of its account. Oracle's account also stores the log of assignments that had been done up to date.
