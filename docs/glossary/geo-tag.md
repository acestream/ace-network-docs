# Geotags


In Ace Network content geotagging is being optionally used to make specific content available for specific territories without exposing actual location of node


In Ace Network, content geotagging is optionally used to make specific content available for specific territories without exposing the actual location of client nodes. In this context geotag is the content marker that contains country code (ISO 3166) and signed by second layer validator. Validators in this context act as oracles that tag content by using a geoip database to discover a node's geolocation (country) by its IP (which is the only data collected from every node for this purpose, IP address is not the subject of further processing of any kind).

The geotag received from the validator is being used as a parameter of the session and is included in all accounting data generated by this session.

Geotagging is optional and can be disabled by the node. If geotagged content is priced differently for different countries, nodes that disable geotagging will pay the highest price.
