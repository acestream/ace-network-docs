# System smart contracts

In Ace Network every system smart contract is represented by separate [operation][1] and serves as basic building blocks of network's economy.

"System" means that such smart contracts are an integral part of the network and could be changed only through network's governance procedures.

System smart contracts code is the part of [Ace Network Core][2] and is publicly accessible.

Full list of system smart contracts are available [here][3]
