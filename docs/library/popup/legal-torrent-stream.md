# The best solution for fighting pirated content on P2P networks in the world

==TODO: english version==

## Relevance of "pirate" problem»

According to the analytical agency Frontier Economics the total losses of copyright holders due to illegal production and distribution of content will reach $ 2.3 trillion by 2022.

According to [U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Global Innovation Policy Center](https://www.theglobalipcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Digital-Video-Piracy.pdf){target = _blank} overall industry revenue is reduced from 11% to 24% due to digital video piracy. The study estimates that "online piracy" costs the economy for instance one country such as the United States at least $ 29.2 billion annually in lost profits. And this is by the most conservative estimates!


!!! info "For example to understand the reality"

    On the day the first episode of Season 8 of the TV show "Game of Thrones" aired the 3.39 million people in the UK watched it on Sky Atlantic and 17.4 million in the US watched the first episode on HBO in the first 24 hours after its release. 

    However, both of these numbers are overshadowed by the number of people using unlicensed streams and torrents to watch this episode of the TV show. The digital piracy agency MUSO tracked 54 million unlicensed views of the first episode of Season 8 in just the first 24 hours after its release.

    This data shows that consumers continue to turn to unlicensed sources to find content despite significant global anti-piracy efforts in recent years and that proves the ineffectiveness of existing standard methods of dealing with unlicensed content.

## The Achilles' heel of the sports industry

In contrast to the music and film industries the problem of "piracy" is a relatively new problem for the sports industry, since for a long time it did not really bother sports leagues in view of the various specific features of this industry.

Most people from sports leagues still think that everything is fine with them, but the truth is that the growth in income from the sale of sports rights which until recently seemed to many to be endless has already ended and the industry turned out to be completely unprepared for the current realities and decisions. large-scale tasks, incl. connected with the active growth in the distribution of unlicensed sports broadcasts.


## A problem of over 36 billion a year!

According to foreign research agencies, the volume of the world market for rights to show sports events is now about $ 50 billion per year.

At the same time, research company Ampere Analysis notes that more than half of sports fans (51%) watch "pirated" (unlicensed) sports broadcast at least once a month. And in a survey commissioned by [Synamedia](https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2020/06/04/synamedia-51-of-sports-fans-watching-pirated-sports-services-once-a- month/){target = _blank} it turned out that among those people who watch illegal sports broadcasts 42% consume sports content daily.

        The survey was conducted in 10 countries and about 6 thousand sports fans took part in it, <a href="https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2020/06/04/synamedia-51-of-sports-fans-watching-pirated-sports-services-once-a-month/" target="_blank">по данным</a> Broadband TV News.

It can be strongly suggested that this level of unlicensed viewing reduces the total industry revenue from 42% to 51% which leads to a loss of income by the sports industry in the amount of over $ 36.2 billion per year + the combined profit of all broadcasters of licensed sports broadcasts

The problem of “piracy” is also very dangerous for the sports industry in that once the large broadcasters (buyers of sports rights) are well aware of the scale of unlicensed sports broadcasts distribution, they begin to view all sports rights as “non-exclusive” and this leads to significant decrease in the current volume of income from the sale of broadcast licensing rights. And this is happening now!

!!! info "For example"
    At an industry summit BeIN Media Group CEO Yousef Al-Obeidli, highlighting the urgency of the “piracy” problem stated that «[glorious media rights bubble» will soon burst](https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2019/10/09/beins-yousef-al-obaidly-industry-unprepared-for-piracy/){target=_blank}, predicting that economical industry model will be completely rewritten. 


## Changes in the media landscape and the need for Ace Stream

Most copyright holders and especially sports leagues and owners of the rights to broadcast sports events are puzzled by the problem of popularisation and mass distribution of unlicensed broadcasts in P2P (peer to peer) networks, such as Sop Cast and Ace Stream, which in itself are absolutely legal and moreover, they are also publicly available and effective broadcasting technologies, which makes it possible to freely use such technologies by anyone and in any way, incl. and for the implementation of unlicensed broadcasting. And in the case of Ace Stream it is also a completely decentralised technology where there is no way to block any broadcasting, in contrast to the partially decentralised SopCast and centralised services.

The world's leading companies specialising in the development of solutions to fight against “piracy” set themselves as their main tasks and significant achievements the creation of solutions that prevent the distribution of unlicensed content using the Ace Stream technology. For example: [https://irdeto.com/news/irdeto-launches-next-generation-of-piracy-control](https://irdeto.com/news/irdeto-launches-next-generation-of-piracy-control){target=_blank}


!!! info "In the end"
    For many, it has already become absolutely clear and obvious that such mechanisms and various standard methods of fighting against the spread of unlicensed content in decentralided P2P networks cannot work, and the seemingly best solutions are ineffective and nothing more than just PR and a way to extract money from rightholders to finance ineffective methods of protecting their rights and interests.

For a long time all kinds of copyright holders have repeatedly asked us to find an effective solution to fix the problem of massive and active distribution of unlicensed content using the Ace Stream technology.

We have set ourselves the task and goal of finding a solution to this problem and helping copyright owners and content providers develop a more expert approach to the problem of "piracy" that will help them increase revenues and reduce the dependence of Internet users on illegal streams in order to stop pouring water to the "pirates" mill.

After conducting all kinds of research, we have prepared a solution that takes into account the social aspects, as well as the interests of all parties and the technological features of open technologies and decentralszed networks, where there is no way to block any broadcasts.

This decision sounds very simple, and so, if there is no way to block unlicensed broadcasts in open decentralised networks, then such broadcasts must be legalised and monetised, taking into account the interests of all market participants, incl. and "pirates"!

As a result, we have developed a compromise solution and effective mechanisms to fight against the spread of unlicensed content in decentralized P2P networks through its legalisation and monetisation.


## A unique and effective solution to fight against pirated content in P2P networks

**Legal Torrent Stream (LTS)** – system of content legalisation and monetisation in peer-to-peer (P2P, peer to peer) networks.

The uniqueness and efficiency of the solution lies in the fact that it is completely decentralized and automated, and its software algorithms contain a compromise that takes into account the interests of all parties:

- Copyright holders receive an audience previously inaccessible to them and a new additional source of income with guaranteed payment for the use of their content

- “Pirates” get the opportunity to legalise their services and distribute remuneration, improving their image and increasing income without the need for direct contacts and any bureaucratic procedures with copyright holders.

- Users receive the maximum convenience, quality and the most flexible conditions for access to content (personal conditions and all kinds of options for accessing content, based on the real capabilities of the user).


Mechanisms for managing digital rights and payments in Ace Stream provide rights holders with the following capabilities:

1. Independently (directly) receive payments for every minute of content playback by Internet users from anywhere in the world or from a particular region.

2. Transfer the rights to receive such payments to other operators (for example: holders of standard broadcasting licenses) in a particular region, as an additional commercial option, thereby increasing the cost of a standard license or simply increasing its value due to this option, or by making a separate sale rights to receive such additional income (at the discretion of the creators of the content and its copyright holders).

3. The choice of payment mechanism: a fixed payment for 1 minute of viewing (only for live broadcasts) or distribution of payments under the system smart contract "Ace Premium Pool"


## How it will work

From the moment the Rightholder activates the mechanism for legalising its content on the Internet, the Rightholder will receive payment for every minute of playback of his content, using Ace Stream technologies, regardless of who and how distributes such content, as well as regardless of which sites/services in which applications and on what devices Internet users will play it

The Ace Network has a unique opportunity for decentralised and completely transparent/open accounting of traffic and broadcast viewing time, with an automated settlement system implemented on one of the most advanced blockchain technologies.

The copyright holders will automatically receive payments and have all the necessary tools for monitoring and auditing the Network in order to be fully confident in the reliability of mutual settlements and accounting for the number of viewing minutes for which payments will be made.

Payments will be made in stablecoins or System tokens by automatically crediting them to the Copyright Holder's crypto wallet by the System upon consumption of its content by Network users, in accordance with the agreed terms that will be fixed in a public smart contract.


!!! info ""

    This opportunity is unique and has no analogues in the world! Thats why content monetisation in decentralised P2P networks should be viewed as a new and previously inaccessible market segment, which makes it possible to obtain an additional source of income without damage to the existing ones.


## Uncompromising compromise

The problem of mass unlicensed content distribution cannot be resolved without the use of content legalisation mechanisms in the world's most popular decentralised online broadcasting network which is actively gaining growth and is globally used by all types of broadcasters to stream unlicensed broadcasts, along with the absence of the possibility of blocking such broadcasts in any way! 


**_A simple ad obvious choice for rightholders_**

_ Today the set of existing technologies already not only allows to operate decentralised P2P broadcasting, but also to form a full-fledged decentralised economy with the highest level of privacy and anonymity, with the ability to build completely decentralised services that cannot be blocked and somehow be interfered with their work._

_This means that all existing standard methods of fighting against the unlicensed content distribution (for example, such as removing content from sites at the request of the copyright holder or completely blocking sites; restricting the work of "pirate" services with financial institutions for accepting and processing payments; identifying organisers of unlicensed broadcasting and the physical location of their servers, for the possibility of filing lawsuits and confiscating the equipment of copyright infringers; etc.) very soon will stop working altogether and will no longer bring any positive results._

_As a result, the copyright holders have to make a very simple and obvious choice, namely: use decentralised mechanisms (protocols and smart contacts) in order to get the above opportunities or refuse such and passively observe the active unlicensed distribution of their content in decentralised networks, which will be impossible stop by any legal and technical means, thereby continuing to pour water on the mills of the "pirates"._

    It is important copyright holders understand the pirate audience is one of their most loyal fans who mainly presents a huge commercial opportunity.
