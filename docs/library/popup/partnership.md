# DAO Ace Stream platforms for affiliate programs 

==TODO: english version==

In addition to the ability for users to view advertisements for a reward, users of the Ace Surf, Ace Search and Ace Script products will also receive rewards for various actions, according to the CPA (Cost per Action) model. For example, for the purchase of goods/services, for registration, etc. Also, users will be provided with various promo codes, coupons and discounts.

How it will be implemented:

## In the search engine Ace Search (Metasearch)

On the main page of search results in accordance with the user's search request there will be displayed offers for goods and services from partner services. When you go to the partner's website and upon the necessary action (according to the terms of a particular partner program) the user will be credited with a reward.

For the users convenience Ace Search will also contain specialised thematic tabs/sections for the following main areas of affiliate programs:

- **Goods**
- **Services**
- **Travels**
- **Sport events**
- **Stocks/Exchanges**
- **Games/Entertaiment**

Other sections/tabs will be added as we receive interesting offers from partners.

## In Ace Surf browser and in Ace Script plugin

Affiliate programs will work not only when using the Ace Search functionality, but also through the SmartLink function, which will be implemented in the Ace Surf browser and the Ace Script extension

Function **«SmartLink»** - when following to affiliate sites the user will be automatically
link with the partner code DAO Ace Stream, allowing the user to
receive bonuses/rewards, according to the terms of the partner site.

Function **«Site Plus»** - when visiting partner sites the user will have access to additional functionality and capabilities that are not provided by the site itself.

Example of implementation:

- When visiting the website of a betting affiliate, the user will be able to watch live broadcasts of sports events in high quality online and will also be able to receive additional information, statistics and analytics on the event in which he will be interested without leaving the affiliate website.

    _Why is this interesting for betting sites and will they recommend their users to use the Ace Surf browser or the Ace Script plugin to visit their sites?_

    - Working with betting on terms that they understand in terms of their existing affiliate programs.
    - Simple and quick integration.
    - There is no need for the cost of purchasing broadcast licenses. Even on the services of the largest betting companies in the world, users now do not have the opportunity to view high-quality sports broadcasts on many sports events (the cost of licenses for high-quality sports broadcasts is estimated in billions of dollars)
    - The ability for users to place bets in the player's full-screen mode, during a live broadcast of a sporting event

    !!! note "Note"
        Watching broadcasts directly on the sites of betting partnerships will be available only to those users for whom betting partnerships pay DAO Ace Stream a reward. The minimum fixed payment per month for one user/player is $ 10 per stream and plus the distribution of income when using an interactive block of bets over broadcasts

Approximate **ARPPU** (eng. Average revenue per paying user) a month while joining affiliate programs is **from 5 to 10$**

The estimated level of audience engagement is 35% of all users per month.

!!! note ""
    Term «engagement» means the action of user in any of affiliate program for which a reward is paid for
