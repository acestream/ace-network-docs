# Ace Stream P2P CDN

**
Green CDN with unlimited bandwidth and the lowest cost of storage and data delivery in the world.
**

**Ace Stream P2P CDN** is the opportunity to provide high-quality direct global broadcasting to a multi-million audience of viewers, even from an ordinary personal device connected to the network at a speed of 100 Mbps without any additional costs, without the participation of intermediaries (centralised servers and data centers) and without harming the environment.


!!! info

    While using Ace Stream technology someone watches the same broadcast together with a neighbor (on the same street, in the same city or country) he takes the data stream not from the server (which may be on the other end of the continent), but directly from neighbor or from all neighbors at once. As a result, the broadcaster with minimal costs can carry out global broadcasting to an unlimited number of viewers and the viewer gets super speed and super quality!


**Relevance of tasks, unprecedented opportunities and characteristics of Ace Stream P2P CDN**

## 1. At the software level elimination of the 50 times deficit of Internet bandwidth which equals to 100,000 Tbps

More than 4.5 billion Internet users are connected to the Internet with an average speed around the world: mobile Internet 53 Mbit/s (mbps), and wired 102 Mbit/s (as of 06.06.2021, according to data [https://www.speedtest.net/global-index](https://www.speedtest.net/global-index){target=_blank})

As of May 5, 2021, the international bandwidth is 2000 Tbps and two thirds of which is used by Google, Facebook, Amazon и Microsoft. (according to data [TeleGeography](https://blog.telegeography.com/2021-international-bandwidth-trends-demand-global-networks){target=_blank})

The bandwidth of the three largest international CDN operators that openly published their data: Cloudflare  - 20 Tbps; Fastly Inc - 25 Tbps; Limelight Networks – 35 Tbps


!!! info

    Using the entire bandwidth of the international Internet and the three largest CDN operators only about 60 million viewers (about 1.3% of all Internet users) could simultaneously watch live broadcasts in quality from 720p to 2160p (4K), HDR, with a frequency 60 frames.

    The calculation was made with an equal proportional distribution of views for the indicated formats, in accordance with the video formats classification and characteristics recommended by Google (look [https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1722171](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1722171){target=_blank}))

Effective scalability and unlimited bandwidth of Ace Stream P2P CDN fully covers the bandwidth deficit of the Internet network in excess of 100,000 Tbps, providing the ability to broadcast live to an unlimited number of concurrent viewers



## 2. Maintenance of quality level and broadcast stability on a par with satellite broadcasting with much greater coverage/reach 

The Internet does not provide any guarantees of reliability and performance when operating the Network in a centralised data delivery mode!

Briefly about main problems:

- Congestion at peering points (traffic exchange)
- Inefficient communication and routing protocols.
- Unreliable networks
- Economic scalability problem
- Last mile problem and poor flow stability
- High costs of online broadcasting

The limitations of unicast technologies prevent CDN operators from providing the level of stability of data delivery and online broadcasting that P2P technologies provide

!!! info

    Currently Ace Stream users watch videos in real/original 4K format (in accordance with a bitrate standard of 66-85 Mbps) and this is almost 10 times higher than the quality of those "marketing" 4K videos (with a bitrate of 8-10 Mbps.) which you can see everywhere on many OTT services that use centralised content delivery technologies (unicast).


## 3. Decrease in online broadcasting costs up to 99.9%, in relation to standard/centralised CDN.

The world's lowest cost of storing and delivering data (in relation to all existing systems, including all kinds of solutions based on other P2P technologies)


## 4. Reliable and trouble-free network

Ace Stream technology can be used without any changes in the existing architecture of the broadcaster on top of standard (unicast) CDNs (as a hybrid CDN solution, unicast + P2P) with the complete absence of implementation risks inherent in new technologies

Lack of vulnerabilities such as signaling servers (central servers that provide communications/connections between peers) are an integral part of most other P2P technologies makimg the system/network practically trouble-free.


## 5. Transparency of traffic accounting and convenience of mutual settlements

An open and completely transparent decentralised system for accounting traffic and viewing time of broadcasts with an automated settlement system implemented on one of the most advanced blockchain technologies

Payment for real but not virtual volumes of transferred data!

There is no need to take on trust CDN operators' word for the amount of used traffic. When using Ace Stream P2P CDN, the broadcaster will be able to independently calculate each GB of traffic received by its viewers, including the amount of data sent by CDN operators, when the broadcaster uses a hybrid (mixed) data transmission model (unicast + P2P)


## 6. Carbon-negative

An environmentally friendly storage and delivery system that reduces the overall global level of CO <sub> 2 </sub> emissions from the streaming industry


!!! info

    About 90% of Internet resources and data centers work for the streaming industry in order to provide about 1% of the real needs of users for online viewing. Accordingly, in order to cover the bandwidth deficit using standard methods, it is necessary to increase the capacity of the centralised infrastructure hundreds of times. At the same time, data centers already use more than 2% of the world's electricity and produce the amount of carbon emissions ** (over 650 million tons / year. CO <sub> 2 </sub>), ** which is five times higher than the level of CO <sub> 2 </sub> emissions from mining Bitcoins **! **

    And if decentralised P2P technologies for storing and delivering data are not actively used for streaming, then data centers will sprang up like mushrooms and according to experts within a decade even with the most energy efficient technologies data centers and digital infrastructure will account for already up to 20% of global electricity consumption and 5.5% of CO emissions <sub> 2 </sub>

_Anyone who streams or watches videos using standard unicast technology and without Ace Stream, while claiming that he cares about the environment and CO2 emissions, is like someone who claims to be a vegetarian, while eating meat!_

## 7. Exit from the "flat internet"

"Nobody is even aware that the internet has flattened" - said Nishanth Sastry, professor, who is specialised in exploring content distribution at King’s College in London. "It happened even without people noticing. We changed Big Ben and nobody noticed."

The new, "flat" structure of the Internet means that content owners like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix have more power and possibility than ever to control how their content reaches the end consumer.This redistributed Internet has led to an intensification of the struggle between the largest Internet companies and traditional telecom operators. With 2/3 of all international Internet bandwidth at their disposal and actively deploying their own private CDNs, corporations are putting a lot of pressure on Internet service providers (ISPs) and making it difficult for other OTT services to work.

At the end of the day, content providers (OTTs) that don't have their own privileged CDNs simply won't be able to compete with companies that own both content on the Internet and the means of delivery; and consumers will have to settle for a limited selection of offers from just a few monopolists

In case of ISP services begin to be massively provided directly by the companies that own all kinds of their own VoD, Live Stream services (for example, such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, etc.) and that is they are seeking to (seeing this is as one of the options for the optimal solution to the problem of the "last mile" and the possibility of complete control of users' surfing on the Web), then there will also be a conflict of business interests between the monopolists themselves. It seems senseless to explain what kind of traffic will be preferred in such a situation. In this case, we can forget about any net neutrality, and accordingly the only one who can provide high guarantees of the quality and stability of the broadcast will be the one who owns the ISP!

Do you want at some point being made to decide between Netflix or YouTube or Apple TV, etc., understanding that by making a choice in favour of some ISP, you can properly use only one of these services ?!  Do you need the Internet from Google in order not to have problems with the work of its services or the Internet from Facebook in order to use its services normally, and do you need such an Internet at all, where you need to make such a choice ?!

!!! cite "Joe McNamee"

    What happens when you have a huge CDN infrastructure and last mile access? You find yourself in another world.

**Solution:** By using the bandwidth of network users, and effectively redistributing the load and data streams between them, the Ace Stream P2P CDN technology makes it economically sensible to create/develop large centralised infrastructures, thereby relieving trunk channels and improving the performance of the entire Internet, as well as saving the environment from the consequences of centralised streaming, and ultimately making the Internet what it was originally planned to be and what it should finally become - decentralised, democratic and environmentally friendly!
