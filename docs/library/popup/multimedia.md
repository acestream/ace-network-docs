Total immersion into multimedia with DAO Ace Stream products and solutions:

## Ace Surf - embodies ideas about what a browser should be

Convenient multimedia interface; maximum satisfaction of user interests in terms of search, consumption and publication of content; openness, security and confidentiality; decentralized P2P technologies for communication, storage and transmission of data; decentralized economy; DApps support (Web 3.0); user control over ad impressions and user rewards for viewing ads; effective incentive programs and a decentralized publisher reward system.

!!! info "Combining the best products and technologies to bring ideas to life"

    Taking the Brave browser and the Opera Neon conceptual solutions as a basis, and complementing this with Ace Stream technologies and products (focusing on decentralization and multimedia, with the understanding that 90% of all Internet traffic comes from the consumption of video and audio content), we decided to create a new innovative product with highly demanded functionality and unique multimedia capabilities!

This browser is more than just a window to the Internet: it is an alternate reality and a window to a better world of multimedia.


## WEB 3.0 (DApps, decentralized apps/sites)

Decentralized analogues of such popular services as Netflix, YouTube, Twitch, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, HBO, ESPN +, etc., with additional functionality and advanced capabilities this is what DAO Ace Stream technologies and tools provide.


## Effective and decentralized search for multimedia content

Ace Search is a metasearch application in the form of local server that can be easily integrated with any browser.

It is an open source metasearch engine that uses data from other search engines, combining results from more than 70 of the most popular search engines (with unlimited expandability), including search results from a Ace Stream decentralized search engine. By sending multiple concurrent queries to several other search engines, it expands the reach of your search and allows you to find more information. The system is confugured for a high level of privacy - users are not tracked or profiled. Alternatively, you can use the "Ace Search" over Tor for anonymity on the Internet.
