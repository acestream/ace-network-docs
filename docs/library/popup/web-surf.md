    - Shared access (social component)

        The user is given the opportunity to open access to his catalog to other users by assigning the appropriate level of access mode for this or that content:

        - «Private» – VoD or live broadcasts which are intended for personal use only;
        - "For the family circle" - access for persons marked as family circle.
        - "Confidential" - opening personal access for the persons specified by the user;

        - "Public" - for all users;
        - "Business" - access for payment (monthly subscription or one-time access)

    - Convenient system for publishing and sharing personal content

        In addition to filling the catalog with content taken from public Internet sources the user will also be given the opportunity to add his personal content to the catalog with the possibility of publishing it on the network using P2P technology with its automatic addition to the decentralised search system and the function of notifying his subscribers.

    - Decentralised content search in public user catalogs
    - The system of comments on pages of content open for access.

2. **P2P accelarators**

    Automatic support for P2P technology for standard online video published on web resources.

    When playing videos, each user will receive a video/audio stream not only from one of the remote video hosting servers, but also simultaneously (additionally) from other users who are watching or have already watched this content

    Thanks to this feature users of a media browser will be able to enjoy watching videos with a much higher level of stream stability than those who will play the same content in any other web browser.

3. **Online playback of video and audio content distributed directly in P2P networks**

    This is the ability to watch a huge number of live broadcasts online (TV channels, sports and e-sports broadcasts, custom channels, concerts, webcams, etc.) and VoD (films, TV series, cartoons, etc.), the publication of which is carried out directly in P2P networks (via BitTorrent protocol, Ace Stream). Content that is not freely available on regular video hosting sites.

    Online torrent playback on any site in one click and without tedious waiting for content download

    Huge selection of music in P2P networks with the ability to play it online in lossless formats

    The highest level of audiovisual quality and stream stability in many respects surpassing all existing broadcasts on the Internet which are using standard technologies (unicast).


4. **Decentralised p2p proxy**.

    Unlike centralised VPN/Proxy traffic will not go through some single peers belonging to the service, but through a set of peers which will be all Ace Stream users. Millions of proxying peers and addresses in the P2P system against several dozen addresses in standard (centralised) VPN/Proxy.

    This will provide users with the opportunity to surf anonymously and access any resources on the Internet, bypassing all kinds of blockages by totalitarian governments that restrict freedom of speech.

5. **Universal media player based on libvlc with p2p support**

    - Playing any video and audio files, including MKV, MP4, AVI, MOV, Ogg, FLAC, TS, M2TS, Wv and AAC, as well as playing network streams that are broadcast via the Ace Stream protocol, BitTorrent, HTTP (S), RTMP , FTP, etc. All codecs included and no need for separate downloads. Subtitles, teletext and closed captions are supported. And also in the presence of all kinds of filters and an equalizer.

    The player is integrated into the browser as a separate process (in fact, it will be a separate application included in the installation package of the browser and has a well-developed integration for easy use in the browser).

    This will give users the opportunity to use a high-quality and advanced player to play videos on sites, instead of standard web players (HTML players hosted on sites). And also, will provide a PIP (picture in picture) function with the ability to close the source tab or even the entire browser and continue to play content (Youtube, Twitch, Livestream, sporting events, etc.). PIP mode will allow the user to watch the video in a small window attached to any part of the screen convenient for him while surfing between other applications or viewing other content on the main screen.

6. **Ace Cast**

    Playback of content in any user-friendly player and/or media center with the ability to stream it to any other device

    This function will allow the user to play content from the pages of sites in any player installed on his device and/or play it on remote devices and TV, through the communication protocols Ace Cast, AirPlay, Google Cast, etc.

By sending multiple concurrent requests to several other search engines it expands the reach of your search and allows you to find more information.
