==TODO: english version==

Too much streaming services (about [only 300](https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/streaming-subscription-fatigue-us-consumers-deloitte-study-1203166046/){target=_blank} в США) lead to growing consumer frustration with multiple subscriptions and services. 43% of surveyed [Deloitte in](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/press-releases/digital-media-trends-thirteenth-edition.html){target=_blank} last year admitted that "refused" from searching for content and 48% stated that it is hard to find what they want in different services. 

The same way the research from October 2019 [TV Time and United Talent Agency](https://www.mesaeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mediamorph-29102019.pdf){target=_blank} (UTA) showed that 80% of surveyed consider that it will be too many streaming services soon. 87% stated that services are becoming too expensive. Respondents also expressed frustration at having to switch between different services (67%), difficulty setting up and managing an account (58%), and inability to find content easily (45%).

In order to fix this problem within the DAO Ace Stream project, especially for content providers and OTT special components/services are prepared:


- Function **«Ace ID»** allows content providers and OTT services instantly provide access to its content on terms of one time payment or per minute tariff and automatically get payment without the need to register/identify users and to refill balance on their services/resources.

- Service **«Premium Pool»** enables any content providers and OTT services to form pools with a single general subscription to their services, getting rid of the need to buy subscription services for each separate OTT service.

    The amount paid by the user for a single general subscription to the pool members services is proportionally distributed among its members, based on the percentage of the total time spent by the user on viewing the content of one or another pool member (for which the calculation is being made), in relation to the total time spent by him to view content from other members of the pool for the estimated period of time.

    The distribution of funds and payments are carried out in a decentralised manner and in an automatic mode, in accordance with the terms of a smart contract (a completely open and transparent system, without any possibilities of manual control and interference in its work).
