# Global decentralized betting platform

Ace Network has a builtin prediction market called "Ace Bet".

**Ace Bet** is a peer-to-peer, decentralized exchange that allows trading the outcome of any events and make unlimited bets on sports, economics, world events and more. The guarantees for performance of participants' obligations are contained in the program code and don't depend on the human or reputation factor.

System integration with Ace Stream protocols allows automatic placement of interactive blocks of bets / predictions in live streams, with the ability to make live bets directly in the player window, in one click and without having to pass tedious registration procedures.

DAO Ace Stream doesn't receive fees (doesn't receive income) from the prediction market. Participants are charged only system payments for processing operations, which are automatically burned after the market closes.
