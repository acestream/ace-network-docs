Term «unique audience» means Internet users who are unreachable for advertisers to show ad impressions in certain formats via other networks and platforms.  

!!! info ""

    **Question** - how Ace Network create «unique audience» for advertisers?

    **Answer** - while using the Metasearch app as the default search engine on mobile and desktop devices, Ace Network becomes available to Internet users for displaying search advertising, since the user commonly uses only one chosen search services. The situation is similar with the Ace Surf browser and the Ace Script plugin as they will remove by default all advertisements on websites and will give opportunity for users only to view ads they can be rewarded for. And thanks to the presence of a universal multimedia player, which the user can use to watch videos on any sites and iStream services, which will satisfy the user's needs for watching videos more than 90%, then he will see video ads that will be published via Ace Network only.

- 100% guarantee there will be no user negativity when viewing ads

    *Lack of negativity towards the advertiser is achieved by rewarding users for viewing ads and by giving the user full control over ad impressions (similar to the model implemented and well-tested in the Brave browser).*

- Most effective ad formats

    - Search contextual advertising
    - Television ads (linear television ads)
    - Video ads in standard digital formats
    - Other ad formats such as "branding", "notifications" and "system advertisements" that will not annoy the user, but will work effectively for the advertiser

The cost of posting a video ad, CPT (cost per thousand contacts): in Russia - $2, in Eastern Europe — $4, in North America — $29, world's average — $20. (according to the agency "Initiative", which is part of the ADV group)

!!! info "Calculation of the cost of posting if we tale into account the duration of video ad"

    When using different time intervals, the factor of using more or less time in an advertising break is taken into account, and the following coefficients are used to calculate the cost of posting an advertising video:

    - 40 to 60 seconds = multiply the cost of ad placement by 2 (since it buys twice as much ad time as a 30-second ad.
    - 30 to 40 seconds = multiply by 1.33
    - 20 to 30 seconds = multiply by 1
    - 10 to 20 seconds = multiply by 0.85
    - up to 10 seconds = multiply by 0.5

**Overall:**

The volume of daily advertising inventory is 1,874,250,000 impressions with a total cost from $ 3,748,500 (CPT $ 2) to $ 37,485,000 (CPT $ 20), depending on the distribution of the audience by region.

The Ace Surf browser and the Ace Script extension (with the corresponding script) will by default replace any third-party In-stream video advertising with their own on all sites visited by the user, including all kinds of social media, which we deliberately do not take into account in the predictions of this section in order to predict as accurately as possible volumes of possible video inventory of Ace Stream DAO. In addition to replacing advertising on sites, the functionality of Ace Stream DAO products will almost 100% cover all user needs in terms of his requests and preferences for video content, thereby removing the need to use any third-party applications intended for watching TV with a movie. , TV series, sporting events, etc., which account for the bulk (almost 100%) of In-stream video ad impressions (outside Social Media). Taking this into account, it can be predicted that Ace Stream DAO will become the only source (platform) for advertisers through which it will be possible to get access to our users for displaying video ads in the In-stream format (outside of Social Media). This means that almost 100% of the total budget for in-stream video advertising (outside of Social Media) allocated by advertisers per Internet user can be determined as the real market value of the Ace Stream DAO inventory volume

Powerful ad formats such as branding, notifications, and systemic advertisements that will not annoy the user but still work effectively for the advertiser

**«Branding»** - advertising images will be shown in a new tab of the Ace Surf browser, in the form of a branded background image of the advertiser and an interactive button going to the advertiser's website.


**«Notifications»** –  the user will see a small neatly designed notification and/or a bonus button, upon clicking on a separate advertiser's page will open (analogous to a clickander, only in a light and presentable form for the user) or a player with an advertising video will be launched.


**«Systemic advertisements»** - messages that will be shown to the user with payment for impressions

These formats are included in the Ad Banners/Display, Rich Media segment and refer to the advertisers' budgets allocated for such an advertising segment.

At the moment, there is still no decision on the frequency of impressions which will be optimal for the user and which will be set by default, that's why we provide an approximate amount of inventory and its cost.
