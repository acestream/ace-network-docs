# Decentralised financial and economic system based on one of the most advanced and reliable blockchain technologies in the world.

Finances and economics are the basis for stability and reliability of any system, especially the decentralised one. Thats why in such an important and responsible part of the DAO Ace Stream project we did not begin to reinvent "wheel" and conduct experiments on users of the Ace Network, but decided to take as a basis one of the most advanced and reliable specialised platforms (blockchain technology - Stellar), and make our own custom “tuning” without violating the fundamental basis of the platform, but simply by adding the necessary “body kit” (additional functionality required for DAO Ace Stream to work)

Components of the financial and economic system:

- **Ace Payments** - a decentralised payment system for direct payments, as well as for micropayments with deferred display in the main Ace Network blockchain when carrying out settlements for traffic and per-minute billing.

    !!!note ""
        The current limit for the stable operation of the blockchain when making direct payments is 2000 transactions per second (T / s) and when making micropayments for traffic and time is 172 million active daily users without any limit on the number of transactions per second.

- **Ace Offer** – a mechanism for emission of digital assets (tokens) secured by the rights of access to content (video, audio, photo), with personalised conditions of the emitter. 

- ** Ace DEX** - a decentralised stock exchange for trading content rights / licenses and other digital assets.

- **Ace Billing** - a decentralised billing for the following tariff plans: 

    - subscriptions for different periods of time
    - per-minute tariffication of online broadcasts
    - one-time paid access to content

- **Ace DeFi** - unique investment programs DeFi

    - **Ace Assets** - participation in the percentage distribution of DAO Ace Stream cryptoassets
    - **Ace Deposit** - charging interest on a deposit
