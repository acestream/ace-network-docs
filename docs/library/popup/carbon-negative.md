# Carbon-negative!

Ace Stream is a decentralized multimedia network with an environmentally friendly data storage and delivery system that reduces the overall global CO2 emissions and protects the environment from the huge damage caused by the centralized streaming industry and unicast technologies.


## The relevance of the problem that Ace Stream solves

For many years, the environmental impact of the ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) industry has gone relatively unnoticed. But its effect is consistent and becomes more and more significant.

According to [Boston Consulting Group (BCG)][1]{target=_blank} research, the ICT industry accounts for 3 to 4% of global CO2 emissions and it is about twice as much as civil aviation.

At the same time, the entire international infrastructure of the Internet using standard centralized technologies (unicast) currently can provide only about 1.2% of the people's real needs in online viewing.

    According to International Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimates, about 4,9 billions of people or 63% of world's population use Internet in 2021. And according to Cisco projections, 5.3 billions of people will be Internet users by 2023.

    Internet users connected to the network at an average around the world speed: mobile internet - 53 Mbps, wired - 102 Mbps (as of 06/06/2021, according to [https://www.speedtest.net/global-index][2]{target=_blank}).

    The penetration of 4K TVs around the world has reached over 50%, and several billions other 4K-enabled devices have already been sold.

    Meanwhile, as of May 5, 2021 international bandwidth of the Internet network is 2000 Tbps two thirds of which are used by Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft (according to [TeleGeography][3]{target=_blank}). The top 3  international CDN operators bandwidth, that published data: Cloudflare - 20 Tbps; Fastly Inc - 25 Tbps; Limelight Networks - 35 Tbps.

    This means that if someone wanted to conduct a global live broadcast of some event and everyone (who has the opportunity) would like to watch it over the Internet (for example, the opening of the Olympics, which is usually watched by over 3 billion viewers), then using all the bandwidth of the international Internet, including all the international resources used by Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft and the resources of the three largest CDN operators, there would be an incident! Only about 60 millions of viewers (around 1.2% of all Internet users) could watch such a broadcast simultaneously in a quality of 720p to 2160p (4K) HDR, with a frequency of 60 frames (with an equally proportional distribution of viewing in the specified formats, in accordance with the classification and characteristics of video formats [recommended by Google][4]{target=_blank})

As you can see, there is almost a 100-fold shortage in the international bandwidth of the Internet, and accordingly, in order to fully meet the needs of Internet users for online viewing at the global level, using centralized technologies (unicast), it is necessary to increase the capacity of existing data centers/CDN by 100 times. As a result, the growth in the share of the ICT industry and its impact on the environment will continue to grow, and at a very high pace...

[Boston Consulting Group (BCG)][1]{target=_blank} predicts that the industry could be responsible for up to 14% of global CO2 emissions by 2040 unless significant steps are taken to reduce the environmental footprint of telecommunications and communications companies. And data centers alone will consume 8% of the world's electricity by 2030.

A similar forecast for future ICT energy demand was made by Anders Andrae, who works on sustainable ICT at Huawei Technologies Sweden in Kista. He predicts data center electricity use is likely to grow by about 15 times by 2030, up to 8% of projected global demand.

    According to U.S. Energy Information Administration ([EIA][6]{target=_blank}) data:

    - Global data centre electricity use in 2020 was 200-250 TWh, or around 1% of global final electricity demand. This excludes energy used for cryptocurrency mining, which was ~100 TWh in 2020, and the energy consumed by data transmission networks, which in 2020 was 260-340 TWh, or 1.1-1.4% of global electricity use.

    - In 2020, global internet traffic [grew by more than 40%][7]{target=_blank} thanks to an increase in video streaming, video conferencing, online gaming and social media. This growth is in addition to the already growing demand for digital services over the past decade. The number of Internet users worldwide [has doubled][8]{target=_blank} since 2010, and global Internet traffic has [increased 15 times][9]{target=_blank} or about 30% per year.

[According to Cisco forecasts for 2022][10]{target=_blank}, video will account for over 82% of the entire Internet traffic. Across the globe, consumer Internet video traffic will reach 240.2 EB per month and 3 trillion minutes of video content will be transmitted over the Internet every month, averaging 4.8 GB of data per hour of video playback.

[Based on the calculated data of The Shift Project][11]{target=_blank}, the use of electricity by data centers for data transmission, excluding "Network impact" (electricity consumed by data transmission networks) and "Device impact" (electricity consumed by user devices), is about 0.072 kWh per 1 GB of data.

!!! note "Alternative calculation for verification"

    Input data:

    The volume of world consumer video traffic, forecast for 2022 (according to Cisco), is 240.2 EB (245,964.8 PB) per month or 2,951,577.6 PB per year.

    World electricity use by data centers in 2020 (according to EIA) - 200-250 TWh

    Even with the most optimistic calculation, if we assume the level of electricity use by data centers in 2022 will not exceed 250 TWh (the maximum use of 2020), then the electricity use of data centers for data transmission will be: 1 PB = 84.7 MWh or 1 GB ~ 0.0847 kWh.

[According to U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)][12]{target=_blank}, CO2 emissions volume is 0,85 pounds (0,38 kg) CO2 per 1 kWh (in the US). This average varies across countries and in some countries reaches the level of over 1 kg per 1 kWh.

Based on the mentioned data: in 2022 watching 1 hour of video (on average 4.8 GB) via centralized data transmission (unicast, from data centers/CDN to ISP) with an energy use of 1 GB = 0.072 kWh and carbon emissions of 0.38 kg CO2 per 1 kWh will leave a carbon footprint of **131 g CO2 emissions per 1 hour of watching a video**

!!! note ""

    In order to better understand the significance of that figure (131 g of CO2 emissions per 1 hour of watching video) let's make one small comparison.

    [According to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)][13]{target=_blank} data, a medium-sized conifer or deciduous tree planted in an urban environment and grown for 10 years captures 10.52 and 17.2 kg (23.2 and 38.0 lb) of carbon over that time period. The average monthly decarbonization rate would be 86 g and 143 g carbon sequestration per conifer and deciduous, respectively.

    If we consider trees solely from the point of view of offsetting CO2 emissions, then it would be quite appropriate to draw the following logical conclusion:

    **Monthly viewing of 1 hour of online video through centralized services via unicast technologies is equivalent to the destruction of one tree that has been grown for 10 years!**

Maxime Efoui-Hess, energy and environment expert at The Shift Project, [said][14]{target=_blank} we urgently need to rethink the future of Internet use.

«We have limited energy resources», [he said][14]{target=_blank} and noted that even if we move to renewable sources of energy, "Internet is the worldwide thing, that's why it would be necessary that every country in the world feed on renewable energy". However, he said that this aim is unreachable for such a short amount of time and that means we cannot afford such a usage of the Internet.

According to The Shift Project data, ten hours of high-definition movie consumes more bits and bytes than all English articles on Wikipedia together.


## Last mile is crucial

Can this growing hunger for videos be satisfied, in a way that spares the climate? Or do we have to go without our favorite streaming TV series and films?

Lutz Stobbe, who researches the environmental impact of information and telecommunications technologies at the Fraunhofer Institute for Reliability and Microintegration in Berlin, [said][14]{target=_blank} that when it comes to data transmission, the last mile is crucial - as in, what specific technology is used to bring the data to the consumer. The shorter your data travels over the network, the less power is consumed.

The use of efficient P2P (peer to peer) technology for storing and transmitting data completely solves the "last mile" problem and is the best solution to the above problem.

!!! note ""

    For example, while using Ace Stream P2P CDN technology, when somebody is watching the same broadcast with a neighbour (on the same street, in the same city or country), he takes the data stream not from the server itself (which may be on the other side of the continent), but directly from a neighbor or from all neighbors at once.

While using the P2P technology for storing and transmitting data, there is a reduction of the load from international backbones/data centers/CDNs by redistributing it between devices of content consumers without causing any additional energy load.


## Achievement of the "Carbon Negative" effect

When someone consumes content through Ace Stream, instead of alternatively consuming content via centralized services, then there is a decrease in CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, since if Ace Stream P2P technology is not used, so the consumption of this content will occur anyway and in equivalent volumes, but only through unicast technologies with CO2 emissions corresponding to such technologies.

As a result, Ace Stream P2P technology eliminates the huge environmental damage caused by data centers and centralized CDNs, while also providing broadcasters (content providers) with the opportunity to provide global broadcasting to an unlimited number of viewers at minimal cost, where the viewer will receive super-speed and super-quality!

And if we once again draw an analogy with trees, solely in terms of their impact on decarbonization, then it would also be quite appropriate to draw one more conclusion:

**Monthly viewing of 1 hour of video in the decentralized Ace Stream network via P2P technology, instead of alternative viewing video through centralized online services via unicast technologies, is the equivalent to planting one tree and growing it for 10 years!**

!!! note "Note to those who care about the environment"

    Anyone who streams, watches videos and listens to music online using standard unicast technologies and without decentralized P2P technologies, while claiming that he cares about the environment and CO2 emissions, is like someone who claims to be a vegetarian, while eating meat!
