# 100% backed tokens and algorithmic stablecoin that generates pleasure and saves the environment

**Ace Token (XAT)** - a basic and automatically burned system token backed by an Internet channel with a bandwidth of over 100,000 Tbps, premium content and all services of the Ace Network.

**Ace Asset (XAS)** - Ace Network protocol management token and backed by the assets of DAO Ace Stream which gives the right to participate in the distribution of system tokens (XAT) and commission fees received by DAO Ace Stream for the Services and Services provided by the Network.

**Ace Coin (XAC)** - an algorithmic stablecoin of the Ace Network which is not pegged to fiat money and commodity, but is provided with the most valuable resource of the online world - traffic volumes and the most valuable resource of the offline world - a person's life time which he spends on the consumption of digital content.

**A short and simple comparison of mining between Ace Coin and Bitcoin/Chia Coin**

Cryptocurrencies and their positioning:

- **Bitcoin - «digital gold»** (the first and the most popular cryptocurrency in the world)
- **Chia Coin - «green coin»** (new green alternative to Bitcoin)
- **Ace Coin - «coin of life»** (generated digital concentration of positive emotions and pleasure of people received by them in the process of creating a coin that saves the Internet and the Environment from the consequences of centralised streaming)

About miners:

- **Bitcoin miners - digging and mining!**
- **Chia Coin miners - plotting and farming!**
- **Ace Coin miners - chilling!**

About mining:

- **Bitcoin mining** - lottery on graphics cards with huge energy consumption and emissions of CO<sub>2</sub>

The University of Cambridge estimates that the total annual electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network is 121.05 terawatt hours (relevant data on [https://cbeci.org](https://cbeci.org))

But Bitcoin's biggest problem is perhaps not even its huge energy consumption, but the fact that a significant proportion of mining enterprises are located in regions that rely heavily on coal power (either directly or for load balancing purposes).Simply put, according to an energy researcher at the Technical University of Munich **Christian Stoll** (Christian Stoll), **«coal fuels bitcoin»** ([https://www.wired.com/story/bitcoins-climate-impact-global-cures-local/](https://www.wired.com/story/bitcoins-climate-impact-global-cures-local/)).

Currently (March 2021) Bitcoin coal footprint is estimated at  **37,82 mill t/year CO<sub>2</sub>**. We can compare it to the carbon dioxide emissions of a country like Slovakia ([https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/)).


- **Chia Coin mining** - lottery on SSD and HDD drives which does not require colossal energy consumption.

Plotting is a process that very quickly destroys disks due to their off-label use (be careful!)

Farming – formation and development of structures of "farms" from SSD and HDD on which disk space will be clogged exclusively with technical data without the possibility of using it for global or personal storage of user files.

!!! note ""

    As a result, this will lead to excitement in the market, a deficit and an increase in prices for SSD and HDD by analogy with video cards used for mining such cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc., which is not at all good for consumers who want to use disks for their intended purpose.

Advantage is that this model is a "more green way of Bitcoin mining".


- **Ace Coin mining** enjoyment of watching videos and listening to music with guaranteed rewards for generating content.

!!! info ""
    Term «Generation of content» means publishing, seeding and proxying content.

    For example, you are watching a video and you give a possibility to watch it for others (automatically supporting its sharing - seeding) and you receive a guaranteed reward for each given Mb of traffic.

Advantages:

- Mining during the usual process for the user (watching videos and listening to music)
- No need for additional costs for the purchase of equipment
- The Network is based on an environmentally friendly data storage and delivery system
- A carbon-negative project that reduces global total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by reducing the streaming industry's need for centralised infrastructure (CDN) and data center expansion
