# TV Next - future of TV channels is here!

_Ace Stream takes Internet broadcasting to a new level and openes up new horizons and unlimited possibilities for TV channels._

**Effective monetisation of linear TV on the Internet and decentralised networks**

The Ace Stream DAO toolkit for television channels allows broadcasting on the Internet with the following indicator **AARPU (Average Ad Revenue per User) - from $ 13.68 to $ 136.8 per year**, depending on the distribution of the audience by region.

**Average AARPU for TV** (based on data from international analytical services) **over $ 40 per year**

**Addressable linear television in the Ace Network**

In addition to the possibilities of broadcasting on the Internet which is not inferior in quality and stability to cable with greater coverage and lower cost than satellite, the Ace Network includes new innovative tools will allow television channels to significantly expand their audience and their capabilities, generating additional income and to increase the AARPU indicators for broadcasting on the Internet.


!!! note ""

    The thing is that rating agencies do not take into account the entire Internet audience of a TV channel (some agencies count viewers, but only on the TV channel website) and accordingly advertisers do not pay TV channels money for their advertisements on the air when they are viewed by Internet viewers. But the income from the usual formats of online advertising (pre-rolls and overlays) is simply not enough for TV channels that create expensive and high-quality content.

TV channels that usually sell 15-17 minutes of advertising time per hour of linear TV based on limited demographic targeting or DMA targeting will be able to sell targeted advertising on the Ace Network, regardless of which sites and applications broadcasting of their TV channel will be carried out and thereby significantly increasing the reach of their audience and using advertising time on their airs as effective as possible to generate additional income.


**Addressable TV + Programmatic**

**The term “addressable”** simply means the ability to target households or individuals. Basically OTT video can be called addressable. However, when you hear the term “addressable television” it means targeting households or individuals in a traditional linear television space.

**Programmatic approach it is a perfect way to monetise addressable ad inventory.**

Brands can engage defined audiences with highly effective, scalable and targeted messages at the right time with addressable TV. This is possible only through the use of data obtained using software technologies.

Besides, software sales can really reveal fully the value of targeted ads as buyers (advertisers) can estimate differently the possibilities of real-time impressions using their own or third-party datasets. This helps to improve the efficiency of advertisers and increase the income of media owners.

**Performance tools and technologies for scaling linear address television and replacing linear advertising spaces**

TV advertising performance tools such as addressable TV and programmatic allow TV channels to have a good monetisation from their Internet audience and advertisers to try new approaches by keeping viewers on the screens during commercial breaks with more relevant messages.

Combination of dynamic inventory with traditional linear ad impressions

- **OAR (Open Addressable Ready)** ([https://projectoar.org/](https://projectoar.org/){target=_blank})

Due to Open Addressable Ready standard, media providers (TV channels) watermark the inventory they want to make addressable. If a TV ad (linear) buyer wants to replace static ads with targeted ads, the system reads the watermark and sends this information to the ad seller's server which changes the targeted ads in real time.

    OAR is a solution that allows advertisers to reach valuable audience in a premium and brand-safe environment on all platforms and at any scale.


- **DAI (Digital Ad Insertion)** Inserting a digital ad video block into a live broadcast

The system function Digital Ad Insertion, based on tags, smooth;y replaces standard on-air TV advertisements in the stream (which are not paid when broadcasting a TV channel to the Internet audience) with targeted and paid digital video advertising directly intended for display on the Internet in accordance with international VAST and VMAP standards

- **ACR (Automatic content recognition)** Monetising broadcasts during their viral (uncontrolled) distribution on the Web

Function Automatic content recognition allows to monetise broadcasts during its viral (uncontrolled) distribution on the Web 


!!! info "Explanation"

    The use of this function, in combination with OAR and the Digital Ad Insertion function, will allow inserting advertising blocks into the broadcasts of TV channels, even in the case of unauthorized rebroadcasting of channels directly by the users themselves (so, if a user decides to capture/take off the signal from satellite and relay the channel to the Internet, then in this case unnecessary/unpaid on-air advertising will be replaced by the official and paid Internet advertising of the copyright holder)

Simply speaking owners of on-air TV channels operating on an advertising model no longer have to worry about the unlicensed and massive distribution of their TV broadcasts on the Internet, since their rights will be fully respected and the monetization model will be preserved, in which the TV channel will receive its guaranteed income from the targeted sale of on-air advertising spaces , regardless of who rebroadcast the TV channel to the Network and regardless of what sites, in what applications and on what devices it is watched 

- **IOTT (Interactive – Over-The-Top)** Interactive services for TV-channels

The IOTT service function is designed to create interactive services over broadcasts (standard: HTML)

!!! note "Note"

    IOTT opens new opportunities for TV-channels, such as organize interactive voting, contests, lotteries and auctions; connect totalizators for sports broadcasts; sell travel certificates and accessories on travel channels, or connect stores to sell items that a user sees on a fashion channel, etc.

**Finally:**

Bringing software capabilities into this environment provides an instantly scalable solution to maximize linear inventory value. The future opportunities for targeted TV will ultimately be monetized through digital processes and technologies where a programmatic approach is a key component.
