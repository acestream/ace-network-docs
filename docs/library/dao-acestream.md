And all this at the stage of solely the most basic applications and functions implementation, without any marketing/advertising costs and without any financial incentives and motivation of the Network Participants! (Detailed information, by audience ...)

!!! info ""

    Term: DAO (decentralised autonomic organisation) — it is a complex form of smart contracts in which the rules of a decentralised organisation are written in the contract code and the management takes place through tokens

**DAO Ace Stream** — it is a decentralised platform with multiple friendly services and apps which are based on paradigm of divided system without dependance on the connection to central control servers 

The DAO Ace Stream ecosystem is based on blockchain technology and has no owners in the traditional sense and anyway it belongs to the public


!!! note ""

    An open and completely decentralised Network with Onion Routing, with a search engine and DApps, in the form of an add-on over the Internet (second-level Internet network) which cannot be blocked or have restricted access to its content without blocking the Internet itself

    The software operates in a decentralised open network with a transparent economy which is based on established software algorithms presented in public smart contracts (open software codes) with complete decentralisation of the regulation of relations, management mechanisms and mutual settlements between its Participants.DAO Ace Stream rules are followed by the protocol itself (program code), actors and social consensus of its Users / Participants.

    No individual can influence the work of DAO Ace Stream!

### 2. Green CDN with unlimited bandwidth and the lowest cost of storage and data delivery in the world

Unprecedented capabilities and characteristics of Ace Stream P2P CDN:

- At the software level elimination of the 50 times deficit of Internet bandwidth which equals to 100,000 Tbps
- Maintenance of quality level and broadcast stability on a par with satellite broadcasting with much greater coverage/reach 
- Decrease in online broadcasting costs up to 99.9%, in relation to standard/centralised CDN.
- Reliable and trouble-free network 
- Transparency of traffic accounting and convenience of mutual settlements
- Carbon-negative
- Exit from the "flat internet"


!!! info "Simple Math for the assessment of Ace Stream P2P CDN"

    Multiply the capacity (bandwidth) of all existing centralised CDNs by 100 and you get a digit corresponding to the bandwidth of Ace Stream P2P CDN

    Divide the cost of centralised CDN services by 100 and you get the cost of Ace Stream P2P CDN

    Multiply by 0 the carbon footprint of data centers working for the streaming industry (currently over 650 Mtpa CO2, by providing only about 1% of people's actual online viewing needs) and you will know the impact level Ace Stream P2P CDN for the environment and you will also be able to understand what environmental benefits the technology can bring, which provides a significant reduction in the load on data centers and removes the need to expand the parks of centralised CDNs

!!! note ""

    An example for assessing investment attractiveness is that the bandwidth of Akamai, the world's largest CDN operator, at the time of the company's capitalisation - $ 11.14 billion, was about 80 Tbps which is many times less than the bandwidth of Ace Stream P2P CDN!

    At the same time it is also necessary to take into account all the costs, restrictions and problems inherent in centralised (unicast) CDNs and which are not in P2P CDN

### 8. Fixing the "subscriptions fatigue" problem

Function **«Ace ID»** allows content providers and OTT services to instantly provide access to its content on the terms of one-time payment access or on the terms of per-minute tariff automatically receiving payment without need to register/identify users and refill balances on their services/resources.   

Service **«Premium Pool»** allows any content providers and OTT services to form pools with a single general subscription to their services getting rid from the need to buy subscription services for each separate OTT service.


!!! info ""

    The amount paid by the user for a single general subscription to the pool members services is proportionally distributed among its members, based on the percentage of the total time spent by the user on viewing the content of one or another pool member (for which the calculation is being made), in relation to the total time spent by him to view content from other members of the pool for the estimated period of time.

    The distribution of funds and payments are carried out in a decentralised manner and in an automatic mode, in accordance with the terms of a smart contract (a completely open and transparent system, without any possibilities of manual control and interference in its work).
