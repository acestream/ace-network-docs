**Ace Stream** – an international project to create a decentralised media platform which was actively developed in 2013 under the programme of business initiatives and with financial support from the European Union.

!!! info ""

    Over 30 million active users and around 50 thousand new installations of Ace Stream software per day (applications for desktop, mobile, stb, browser plugins). And all this at the stage of solely the most basic applications and functions implementation, without any marketing/advertising costs and without any financial incentives and motivation of the Network Participants! (Detailed information, by audience ...)

DAO Ace Stream marks the next planned development stage of the Ace Stream project which has already become the world's most popular decentralised solution for online streaming using P2P (peer to peer) technology

!!! info ""

    Term: DAO (decentralised autonomic organisation) — it is a complex form of smart contracts in which the rules of a decentralised organisation are written in the contract code and the management takes place through tokens

**DAO Ace Stream** — it is a decentralised platform with multiple friendly services and apps which are based on paradigm of divided system without dependance on the connection to central control servers 

The DAO Ace Stream ecosystem is based on blockchain technology and has no owners in the traditional sense and anyway it belongs to the public


!!! note ""

    An open and completely decentralised Network with Onion Routing, with a search engine and DApps, in the form of an add-on over the Internet (second-level Internet network) which cannot be blocked or have restricted access to its content without blocking the Internet itself

    The software operates in a decentralised open network with a transparent economy which is based on established software algorithms presented in public smart contracts (open software codes) with complete decentralisation of the regulation of relations, management mechanisms and mutual settlements between its Participants.DAO Ace Stream rules are followed by the protocol itself (program code), actors and social consensus of its Users / Participants.

    No individual can influence the work of DAO Ace Stream!

## Key technologies

**Ace Stream** – a decentralised technology of P2P comms, storage and delivery of multimedia data focused on online broadcasting. 

**P2P Search** – an open system of indexation and searching for content in decentralised network 

**Ace Network** (further on: Network) – it is a self-regulated decentralised network with open source for dealing with digital assets.

**Ace Services** - a platform for creating decentralised services/apps (DApps)

## Relevance of DAO Ace Stream Solutions

### 1. Carbon-negative!

Ace Stream is a decentralized multimedia network with an environmentally friendly data storage and delivery system that reduces the overall global CO2 emissions and protects the environment from the huge damage caused by the centralized streaming industry and unicast technologies.

!!! info ""

    About 80% of the Internet resources and data centers work for the streaming industry to provide only about 1% of the users' real needs in online viewing. Accordingly, in order to cover the bandwidth deficit using standard methods it is necessary to increase the capacity of the centralized infrastructure hundreds of times. At the same time, the ICT industry already accounts from 3 to 4% of global CO2 emissions (according to [BCG][5]{target=_blank}) and among them ¼ falls directly on data centers/CDN to ensure the processing, storage and delivery of video content

The "Carbon Negative" effect is achieved by reducing the load from international backbones/data centers/CDNs and redistributing it between devices of content consumers that do not carry any additional energy load. As a result, when someone consumes content through Ace Stream, instead of alternatively consuming content through centralized services, there is a decrease in CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, because if Ace Stream P2P technology is not used, then this content will be consumed in any case and in equivalent volumes, but only through unicast technologies with corresponding to such technologies CO2 emissions

!!! info ""

    1 hour of video viewing in the decentralized Ace Stream network through P2P technology, instead of alternative viewing video through the centralized online-services and unicast technologies, decreases the CO2 emissions into atmosphere for 131 g on average that equals for the average monthly decarbonization rate of one conifer and deciduous tree (86 g and 143 g of carbon capture, one conifer and deciduous tree, respectively) that has been grown for 10 years.

### 3. The solution for the "subscriptions fatigue" problem

Function **«Ace ID»** allows content providers and OTT services to instantly provide access to its content on the terms of one-time payment access or on the terms of per-minute tariff automatically receiving payment without need to register/identify users and refill balances on their services/resources.

Service **«Premium Pool»** allows any content providers and OTT services to form pools with a single general subscription to their services getting rid from the need to buy subscription services for each separate OTT service.


!!! info ""

    The amount paid by the user for a single general subscription to the pool members services is proportionally distributed among its members, based on the percentage of the total time spent by the user on viewing the content of one or another pool member (for which the calculation is being made), in relation to the total time spent by him to view content from other members of the pool for the estimated period of time.

    The distribution of funds and payments are carried out in a decentralised manner and in an automatic mode, in accordance with the terms of a smart contract (a completely open and transparent system, without any possibilities of manual control and interference in its work).

### 4. Green CDN with unlimited bandwidth and the lowest cost of storage and data delivery in the world

Unprecedented capabilities and characteristics of Ace Stream P2P CDN:

- Elimination at the software level of a 100-fold shortage of Internet bandwidth which equals to 200,000 Tbps
- Maintenance of quality level and broadcast stability on a par with satellite broadcasting with much greater coverage/reach 
- Decrease in online broadcasting costs up to 99.9%, in relation to standard/centralised CDN
- Reliable and trouble-free network 
- Transparency of traffic accounting and convenience of mutual settlements
- Carbon-negative
- Exit from the "flat internet"


!!! info "Simple Math for the assessment of Ace Stream P2P CDN"

    Multiply the capacity (bandwidth) of all existing centralised CDNs by 100 and you get a digit corresponding to the bandwidth of Ace Stream P2P CDN

    Divide the cost of centralised CDN services by 100 and you get the cost of Ace Stream P2P CDN

    Multiply by 0 the carbon footprint of the data centers/CDNs that support the streaming industry and you'll find out how much decarbonization an Ace Stream P2P CDN can achieve and the environmental benefits it brings.

    Look at the capitalization of the largest centralized CDNs, compare the above indicators with their similar indicators, and you will be able to assess the investment attractiveness of Ace Stream P2P CDN.

!!! note "An example"

    The bandwidth of Akamai, the world's largest CDN operator, at the time of the company's capitalisation in $11.14 billion, was about 80 Tbps which is many times less than the bandwidth of Ace Stream P2P CDN!

    At the same time it is also necessary to take into account all the costs, restrictions and problems inherent in centralised (unicast) CDNs and which are not in P2P CDN.

    And of course, be sure to take into account the amount of electricity used or the bandwidth of the CDN operator, and multiply them by the corresponding values (0.38 kg CO2 per 1 kWh and 1 GB ~ 0.072 kWh, respectively) to find out the level of carbon footprint of this centralized CDN in comparison with Ace Stream P2P CDN.
