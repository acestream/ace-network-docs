# Intro

Ace Stream Engine is the core component of Ace Stream software ecosystem. It is a standalone process that runs in the background and implements all the functionality of the Ace Stream node. The other software (both Ace Stream and third-party applications) access the engine via [HTTP API][1]. The engine acts a a gateway between local applications and Ace Stream P2P network.

In this section we will describe all the features that the engine provides to app developers.
