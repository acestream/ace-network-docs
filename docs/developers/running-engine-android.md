# Using the Engine on Android

To start engine on Android you should bind to Ace Stream Service and send a "start" command to this service.

The preferred way to start engine is to use Ace Stream Client helper module:

The example application which shows usage of this module is here:

After starting service you should work with Ace Stream engine using the HTTP API
