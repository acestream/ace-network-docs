    To obtain rights to Ace Stream DAO assets, the owners of these tokens have to register in the [Ace Assets][2] DeFi program


## Token issuing

XAS is issued in a one-time amount of 1,000,000,000 XAS.

Initial rate of XAS token at the start of sales: 1 "Ace Asset" = $1


## Initial offering

The initial offering is 100 million Ace Asset tokens, of which:Â 

- The sale of the first 20 million is carried out on preliminary applications, with a minimum redemption  of 10 thousand and with a discount of up to 30%, according to the following formula:

    ```
    D=5% for 10,000 <= X < 100,000
    D=10% for 100,000 <= X < 1,000,000
    D=(11 + FLOOR(X / 1,000,000))% for X >= 1,000,000

    Where:
    D - discount
    X - number of tokens to buy
    ```

- The next 30 million will be sold in a closed bid auction format, where participants will be invited to bid on the purchase price for the volume of tokens they are interested in, with a minimum bid of 1 Ace Asset = $1

- The sale of the rest of the initial placement, amounting to 50 million tokens, will be carried out in the format of an open auction, with the starting price corresponding to the arithmetic average of the redemption price of tokens at the closed offer auction.
