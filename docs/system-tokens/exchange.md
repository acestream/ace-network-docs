# Token exchange


The internal distributed exchange module is being used by system smart contracts when they need
to perform any exchange operation between network's assets.

It is also possible to connect third-party decentralized exchanges.
Initial network's launch won't enable the exchange, it can only be turned on as a result of a vote of [XAS][1] holders.
