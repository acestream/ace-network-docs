# System tokens


System tokens are tokens native to Ace Network. They have existed on the network
network since its launch, and unlike [assets][1] do not require [issuer][2]
or [trustline][3].

"Native" - means that the token is an integral part of Ace Network.

There are three system tokens in the Ace Network:

- [Ace Token (XAT)][4] - Ace Netwok's basic system token
- [Ace Coin (XAC)][5] - algorithmic stablecoin
- [Ace Asset (XAS)][6] - Ace Stream DAO protocol and asset management token
