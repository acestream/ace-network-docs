# Payment for Traffic

Traffic can be paid with any of the three system tokens: [XAC][5], [XAT][6], [XAS][7].

Payment for traffic is carried out automatically from [account for payment for services][1]
within the work of the system [traffic and time accounting][2]

Details of payment algorithms are described [here][5]

The network takes a commission of 10% from each payment for traffic.
The commission is paid by the payee.
Commission is transferred to the system pool [`trafficFeePool`][4]
