Ace Assets is a De-Fi incentive program for "Ace Stream Token (AST)" token holders that entitles its members to receive payouts from the Ace Stream DAO reward pool.


## Activation and deactivation of "Ace Assets" program

[AST][4] tokens are required to participate in the "Ace Assets" program and receive payments from the reward pool

To obtain the rights to own crypto assets of the Network and to participate in their distribution, you need to deposit AST tokens on a specialized account of your personal wallet, with the same name "Ace Asset", after which these tokens will be automatically linked to the smart contact [Ace Assets][2] and participate in this program.

The owner of tokens at any time can withdraw them (partially or completely) from the Ace Assets program by transferring them to the main account of his wallet, and use them to pay for services and services of the Network

Withdrawal transaction will automatically disconnect tokens from the "Ace Assets" program. To renew it, the owner of the tokens will need to re-activate the "Ace Assets" program in their wallet (as described above).

## Reward Pool

The reward pool is formed from the funds received by Ace Stream DAO from the issue and sale of [Ace Byte][3] (XAB) tokens, as well as from the Network's fees for the services provided
