# User's Channels

Users are able to create and publish their own channels, which are named groups of any content that could be published. Channels can be shared with other users and provide useful mechanisms to manage access levels. There are no limits to how many channels can be created per user.



## Access levels

- private — only creator has an access
- limited access — only approved accounts have an access (including conditionally approved, for example, those who paid subscription fee)
- public access — everyone has an access


## Payment for access

The channel's owner can assign a payment policy to their content.
