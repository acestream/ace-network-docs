# The list of operations


The [operations][1] described here are specific to the Ace Network, they are additional to and extend Stellar's list of [standard operations][2].

There are two kinds of operations: system smart contracts and standard operations.
Instead of other operations, system smart contracts could:

-  be intiated on the network by any account, but not more frequently than a specified interval
-  affect some subset of accounts without requiring the signature of each affected account
